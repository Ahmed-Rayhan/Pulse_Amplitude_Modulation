# Pulse_Amplitude_Modulation

**This MATLAB code revolves around Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM). It starts by generating a cosine wave as the message signal, introducing Gaussian noise based on a user-defined Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The modulated signal is created by multiplying the noisy message signal with a pulse train signal acting as the carrier. Demodulation follows, using a low-pass Butterworth filter to retrieve the original message signal. There's also an amplification step, boosting the demodulated signal. The code concludes with a series of insightful plots showcasing the progression from the clean message signal to the final demodulated output. It's a hands-on exploration of PAM, noise impact, and signal processing in the MATLAB environment! ðŸŒŸ

This code can be used to design out Matlab App on PULSE AMPLITUDE MODULATION. 

User can Generate a input signal by providing the following parameter:

Signal to Noise Ration SNR
Modulation Index

Upon providing a signal as input, The app shows 
1. message signal  
2. Pulse Train
3. Message signal with Gaussian noise effect
4. Pulse Amplitude Modulated signal
5. Finally, the demodulated signal on the receiving end

This app can be a great tool to demonstrate different kind of effects during Pulse Amplitude Modulation. 
This app can be a potent educational tool for grasping Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM). With vivid visualizations, it enables users to easily comprehend the effects of noise, modulation, and demodulation.
